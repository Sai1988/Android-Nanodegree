The goal is to create a tour guide app which presents relevant information to a user whoâ€™s visiting my city.\
Below are the key features implemented in the project:
1. Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information.
2. Building layouts to display those lists of data.
3. Navigating between those lists using intents and multiple Activities or a ViewPager.
4. Creating your own custom classes.
5. Properly handling images.
